This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
mpg
```

## Creating a ggplot

Plot the negative relationship between engine size (displ) and fuel efficiency(hwy)
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```

Now let's map the class of vehicle to the color of your points to reveal that relationship as well.

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class))
```

Instead what if we mapped the shape of the point to class variable

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, shape = class))
```

## Facets

One way to add additional variables is with aesthetics. Another way, particularly useful for categorical variables, is to split your plot into facets.
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  facet_wrap(~ class, nrow = 2)
```

Facet plot on the combination of two variables, add facet_grid()
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  facet_grid(drv ~ cyl)
```

Change the type of the plot to smooth line
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```

Set a different line for each drv type in this data:
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, linetype = drv))
```

let's color the points as per these groups
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, group = drv))
```

Let's add multiple geoms to a single plot,
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) 
```

We can make it clear by overlaying the lines on top of the raw data and then coloring everything according to drv

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()
```

If you place mappings in a geom function, ggplot2 will treat them as local mappings for the layer. It will use these mappings to extend or overwrite the gloval mappings for that layer only. This allows different aesthetics in different layers:
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = class)) +
  geom_smooth()
```

You can use the same idea to specify different data for each layer. Smooth line displays just a subset of the mpg datasetm the subcompact cars.
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = class)) +
  geom_smooth(data = filter(mpg, class == "subcompact"),
              se = FALSE)
```

Exercise - Create plot
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()
```
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(group = drv))
```
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()
```
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = drv)) +
  geom_smooth()
```
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = drv)) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(linetype = drv))
```
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = drv))
```

## Statisitical Transformation
The diamonds dataset comes in ggplot2 and contains information about 54000 diamonds.

This chart shows that are diamonds are available with high quality cuts thn with low quality cuts.
```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(x = cut)) +
  geom_bar()
```

This above chart is equivalent to the following piece of code:
```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  stat_count(mapping = aes(x = cut))
```

We can override the default mapping from transformed variables to aesthetics. For example, you might want to display a bar chart of proportion, rather than count:
```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, y = ..prop.., group = 1) )
```

You might want to summarize the y-value for each unique x value, to draw attention to the summary that you're computing:

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  stat_summary(
    mapping = aes(x = cut, y = depth),
    fun.ymin = min,
    fun.ymax = max,
    fun.y = median
  )
```

Let's look at the diamonds by cut and clarity:
```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = clarity))
```

Let's look with in each group, the distribution of clarity:
```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = cut, fill = clarity), position = "fill") 
  
```

Better way to plot a lot of overlapping points, is to add jitter to the scatter plots. This can be done as follows:
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(position = "jitter")
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(position = "jitter")
```
